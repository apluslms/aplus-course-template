How to publish your course
--------------------------

Once your course is ready to be published, you can send an email to the A+ team with the following information.

::::

Email: aplusguru@cs.aalto.fi
................................

Subject
.......
If you are publishing a course for the first time add the following subject **"Publish <name of the course>"**, but if
you want to create a new instance of an existing course add the following subject instead
**"Create a new instance of the <name of the course>"**. The **<name of the course>** should be the name used in Oodi or
Sisu, e.g. CS-40110 Automated systems.

Body
....
:raw-html:`<input type="checkbox">` **Term and Year:** [spring | summer | autumm | annual course] + YEAR

:raw-html:`<input type="checkbox">` **Start and end of the course:** Provide tentative start and end dates of the course.
Notwithstanding, you must set those dates in the **index.rst.** or in the **conf.py** files.

:raw-html:`<input type="checkbox">` **List of teachers and course assistants:** Please provide the first and last name of
the teachers in charge of the course.

:raw-html:`<input type="checkbox">` **URL Key:** The URL key is only an identifier that will be used in the URL of your
course. By default, we will use the course code as a URL key, i.e. CS-40110. However, you can define a more meaningful,
easy to remember and catchy URL key. Some examples of course URL keys are: o1, traky, and hoscic.
- **You only need to provide this key if you are creating a new course, new instances already have this key** -

:raw-html:`<input type="checkbox">` **GitLab URL:**  You must send us the Gitlab URL of your course repository. If you
are an Aalto user, the course content should be stored in https://version.aalto.fi, and preferably under the
`course group <https://version-aalto>`_. If for some reason you want to keep the course repository private, you must add
the following A+ members to your repository with the "Reporter" role.

- Teemu Lehtinen - **@lehtint6**
- Markku Riekkinen - **@riekkim1**
- Jhosimar Aguacia - **@aguacij1**

:raw-html:`<input type="checkbox">` **Branch name:** The recommendation is to have one branch per instance of the course.
Therefore, every time you want us to publish your course, you should let us know which branch you want to use. The names
of the branch should be short and meaningful, e.g., `summer-2020`, `2020`, `autumn-2021`,
